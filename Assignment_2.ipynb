        "**Submission deadline:** Friday, 8th November 2024, at 17:00:00 AEDT.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Submission:** You can submit your solution via the give system using the command ``give cs9414 ass2 ass2.ipynb``.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Instructions:**\n",
        "* This is an **individual** assignment.\n",
        "* Write your name and zID on the top of this Jupyter Notebook.\n",
        "* You can only use the libraries listed in this notebook\n",
        "* You can reuse any piece of source code developed in the tutorials.\n",
        "* Do not modify the existing code in this notebook except to answer the questions. The cells that should be modified are indicated.\n",
        "* If you want to submit additional code (e.g., for generating plots), write it at the end of the notebook.\n",
        "* This notebook is worth **75** marks and will be rescaled to **25** marks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Late Submission Policy:** A 5% reduction of the assignment value (i.e. 1.25 marks) will be applied per day for late submissions. For example, if an assignment gets an on-time mark of $20/25$ but is submitted three days late, the penalty will be $3*1.25 = 3.75$, so the final mark will be $16.25$. After five days, the assignment total mark will be reduced to 0 ($100\\%$ reduction). An assignment is considered one day late if submitted any time after the submission deadline, up to 24 hours past it.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Plagiarism:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember that ALL work submitted for this assignment must be your own work, and no sharing or copying of code or answers is allowed. You may discuss the assignment with other students but must not collaborate to develop answers to the questions. You may use code from the Internet only with suitable attribution of the source. You may not use ChatGPT or any similar software to generate any part of your explanations, evaluations or code. Do not use public code repositories on sites such as GitHub or file-sharing sites such as Google Drive to save any part of your work &ndash; make sure your code repository or cloud storage is private, and do not share any links. This also applies after you have finished the course, as we do not want next year’s students accessing your solution, and plagiarism penalties can still apply after the course has finished.\n",
        "\n",
        "All submitted assignments will be run through plagiarism detection software to detect similarities to other submissions, including from past years. You should **carefully** read the UNSW policy on academic integrity and plagiarism (linked from the course web page), noting, in particular, that collusion (working together on an assignment or sharing parts of assignment solutions) is a form of plagiarism.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, do not use any contract cheating “academies” or online “tutoring” services. This counts as serious misconduct with heavy penalties up to automatic failure of the course with 0 marks and expulsion from the university for repeat offenders."

        "\n",
        "Your first task is to preprocess the datasets. Preprocessing usually involves data cleaning and transformation to improve data quality and prepare the data for the specific requirements of the learning approaches.\n",
        "\n",
        "For data preparation, we have the following tasks:\n",
        "1. **Missing imputation (all models)**: The adult dataset has missing values, and none of our learning algorithm implementations can directly handle missing data. Two missing data treatments are eliminating the rows with missing data or replacing the missing values with estimated ones. *Mean imputation*, as the name suggests, replaces missing values with the attribute mean, median (continuous features) or mode (discrete features). These statistics must only be estimated in the training set.\n",
        "2. **Feature encoding (all models)**: Neural networks, tree and random forest implementations available in the Scikit-Learn library do not handle categorical attributes directly. Therefore, these attributes need to be converted into numerical attributes. Although several encoding approaches exist, we will use one-hot encoding, as it is simple and recommended for categorical features with a small cardinality.\n",
        "3. **Class attribute encoding (neural networks only)**: Neural networks also need a one-hot encoding for the class attribute. This step is not necessary for the tree models.\n",
        "4. **Rescaling attribute values (neural networks only)**: The neural network's training benefits from rescaling the attribute values. In this task, we will convert each attribute to a number in the 0 to 1 range by using a simple linear rescaling: $x_s = \\frac{x-min_f}{max_f-min_f}$, where $x_s$ is the recalled $x$ value, $min_f$ is the minimum and $max_f$ the maximum values for feature $f$ in the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tree models typically do not use class encoding and rescaling. The reason is twofold: first, this preprocessing does not help these models fit better parameters; second, tree models are known for their interpretability, and these manipulations create models that are not easier and often harder to understand. Feature encoding is also unnecessary for many tree model implementations, including the well-known [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Unfortunately, the Scikit-Learn implementation of tree models does not support categorical attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Warning**: Leaking information from the test set to the training set, even if such information is aggregated data such as means, maximums, and minimums, is considered a serious methodological error. For instance, mean imputation should use the mean only in the training set. Similarly, the maximum and minimum for attribute rescaling should be calculated in the training set. Consequently, we may see values outside the range of 0-1 in the rescaled test set. This mimics the situation in which we find extreme values after the model deployment."
